# Project Proposal

### Project title

Defrost

### What and why?

Defrost would be a review aggregator for frozen foods and other similar products sold by grocery stores. Since many people do eat frozen and processed foods due to convenience and other factors, there would be a large amount of potential users that would provide reviews and feedback on the wide variety of products in grocery store aisles. Different brands may swing in quality from dish to dish, so relying on simple brand loyalty is unreliable, and there is always the case where one may have never tried this kind of dish before and needs advice. Additionally, in many cases the picture on the packaging is misleading, looking like an actual item you could be served in the restaurant, but in reality the actual dish is sad and unappealing. Defrost could solve these problems by gathering reviews and pictures of frozen and other convenience products in an easily accessible location.

### For whom?

This is for people who eat frozen food and similar goods like instant ramen, and could even be expanded to other prepackaged snacks and drinks.

### How?

The application will have a database of items (foods and other goods) with reviews attached to each item entry. Users will be able to see all reviews for an item that they search, along with an aggregated sentiment of the reviews with the item. Users reviewing an item will be able to add it under a categorization system (if not existing) and attach images along with the review in order to verify authenticity. Users would also be able to rate the reviews according to how helpful, relevant, or true they were.

### Scope

The application would require an authentication setup for each user, database integration to store the reviews, and potentially a method to rate the reviews based on content and sentiment to quickly allow users to decide the positivity of it. All in all, it should not be trivial to setup.
